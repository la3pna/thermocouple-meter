**Build instructions**

The PCB fits the standard chinese 100 * 76 * 35mm aluminium enclosures available on ebay. 
PCB's and front panels may be available from me, contact me for information. 

* Mount and solder the SMD's on the main PCB. 
* Mount and solder the socket for the SV1 Expantion port if you intend to build the 4 probe version. 
* Fit the 2 thermocouple connectors to the PCB. 
  - Start by opening the connector and remove all screws and nuts. 
  - Mount the connectors to the PCB using 2 M2 screws and the nuts. The screws goes from the connection tab, via the connector and through the PCB. The nut is fitted on the bottom of the PCB. 
* Mount the backpanel to the bottom part of the enclosure. This is to make sure the alignments are correct.
* Fit the headers to the bottom of the PCB. If your Empyrean comes with the headers fitted, skip this step.
* Mount the Empyrean to the top of the PCB, Do not solder it yet.
* Mount the powerjack, but do not solder it yet.  
* Fit the whole PCB assembly into the board, and see that the connectors fits as it should. 
* Adjust the powerjack and Empyrean PCB so that their connectors fit correctly then solder them to the PCB.
* Add the 2 resistors just below the display to the front panel boards. These determine the power connections to the display.
* Solder the angled row connector to the main PCB.
* Slide the display PCB onto the main PCB and solder it in place.
* Mount the power switch to the PCB, but only solder the end pin.
* Cut the display connector row on the solder side so that it does not protude in front of the display. This is to avoid it shorting to the front panel. 
* Mount the display, but do not solder yet.
* Slide the PCB back into the bottom part of the box, and mount the font panel.  
* Holding the display in its connector, adjust it so that it's position is correct, then tack it down and adjust it so its position is correct on the front panel.
* Solder the display and power switch to the PCB.
* Its time to upload the program and test that it works as it should.
